# ToDo-List

To Do List (v2 in the course, added a database) made with HTML + CSS + JavaScript and EJS + ExpressJS + Mongoose. 
Linked with Atlas for database to hold items added to lists. 
The website is dynamic (try adding /{words} to the end of the link for a newly titled page/list! But be careful, all updates are public to 
          everyone and appear in my database!)

Made in Angela's Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
*Projects uploaded from Angela's course are my own work with reference to hers (mainly the CSS). 
          The course follows a structure where you're given a challenge and told to code it based on the module.
          These uploads from the course are my work where I then used the course to critique and correct mine (if needed only as a last resort)
